      Kenya Rice Pilau (Rice Pilaf) Recipe
      Ingredients (6 servings)
      1 pound goat, mutton or beef cubes
      4 garlic cloves
      Salt
      9 cardamom pods
      4 tbsp vegetable oil
      1 large onion, chopped
      3 cups rice
      10 whole black peppercorns
      8 whole cloves
      8 cinnamon sticks
      1 tsp ground ginger
      Â¼ cup cumin seed powder
      4 small tomatoes
      6 cups water

      Boil the meat in salted water until tender. Crush the garlic and cardamom together with 2tbsp water using a mortar and pestle. Sautee the onion until it is golden brown. Add the rice, meat, garlic and cardamom mixture, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, ginger and cumin seed powder. Cook covered over medium heat until all are nicely brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes. Cook and stir until the tomatoes are thoroughly cooked down to the consistency of a sauce. Add the 6 cups water to the rice mixture, bring to a boil and then cook over very low heat, (while covered) for another 15-20 minutes, until all water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through. Serve with kachumbari.
