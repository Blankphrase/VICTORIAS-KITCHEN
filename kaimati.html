      Kaimatis are an indulgent Kenyan Coast specialty where by, gooey dough balls are coated with sensational syrup. In addition to tasting heavenly, they are also extremely easy to make.

In many Households, these delicacies are mostly prepared during the Holy Month of Ramadhan as a dessert or a delightful snack, but they can also be found on the humid streets of the Kenyan Coast as street food anytime of the year…

Ingredients

1 cup all purpose flour

½ cup natural plain yoghurt

½ cup water

1 teaspoon instant yeast

1 teaspoon sugar

1 teaspoon cinnamon powder

Ingredients for the Syrup

1 cup sugar

1 cup water

2 tablespoons ground cardamom

1 tablespoon lemon juice

Grated lemon rids (optional)

Instructions

In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix very well till the batter becomes sticky

Cover and set aside for 1-2 hours to puff up (can also leave it aside overnight)

In the meantime, prepare the syrup by;

Adding sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and add lemon juice (grated lemon rinds) and cardamom then simmer for about 5-8 minutes or till it’s sticky. The syrup should coat a spoon when ready

Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely

In a wok, heat 2 cups of vegetable oil and using a small ice cream scoop or a spoon, drop dumplings in the hot oil and fry till golden brown

Drop in the ready dumplings in the syrup and coat them for one minute (the longer you leave them the more syrup they’ll absolve hence becoming very sweet)

Another way of enjoying kaimatis is by coating them with powdered sugar

Or with melted chocolate
