      Recipe for Ugali
Ingredients (4 servings)
4 cups water
4 cups maize meal or corn meal flour

Bring water to a boil in a pan. Add the corn or maize meal and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture is thick and smooth. Make sure it is not too stiff. Add boiling water if it is too thick. Gather the mixture in the middle of the pan and turn the heat to low. Cover the pan and leave it on low heat for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally. Flip the ugali onto a plate and, after it cools a bit, form it into a "cake". Slice and serve with chicken, beef, fish or meat stew and a cooked vegetable dish or even sour milk (buttermilk).
