    <div class="chapati">

Ingredients (6 servings)
<br>
1 cup of whole wheat flour
<br>
1 cup white flour
<br>
2 tbsp oil or ghee
<br>
3/4 - 1 cup of warm water
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
Mix the flour in a bowl and add salt and oil.
<br> You can mix with clean hands, or use a mixer or food processor.
<br>
Add a little bit of water at a time and knead well for about 10 minutes until you have a stiff and smooth dough. <br>Cover the dough and let it stand for at least 30 minutes up to two hours.<br> Knead the dough well again and divide it into egg-sized balls.<br> Dust each ball with extra flour.<br> Flatten each ball and roll out thinly into sizeable circles.
<br>
Heat an ungreased, heavy skillet or griddle over a medium flame.<br> Lightly grease the pan and slowly heat the first chapati.<br> Cook on one side for about 1 minute or until lightly brown,<br> then flip and brown the other side.<br> Press the sides of the chapati with a spoon until it puffs.<br> Remove the chapati from the skillet into a warm dish or foil paper and wrap it to keep it warm.<br> Repeat this process for every chapati, wiping the pan with greased paper every time a new chapati is to be cooked.
<br>
Serve the chapatis warm with a meat stew and/or cooked vegetables.<br> Chapatis can also be served with hot milk or chai.
