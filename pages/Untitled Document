Uji (Fermented Porridge) Recipe
Ingredients
½ cup maize meal or corn meal flour 
¼ cup millet flour 
¼ cup sorghum flour 
Water 
Sugar to taste

Put all of the flour into a plastic container and mix well. Pour enough water into the mixture to make a paste. Mix well, cover and leave the mixture at room temperature for 2 days so it can ferment. Skim out the froth that has formed on top of the water, stir the mixture and pour it into a cooking pan. Cook at medium to high heat, stirring continuously until it thickens. You can add more water as needed until the uji cooks into a smooth, runny consistency. Add sugar to taste.

*You can skip the fermentation process by buying ready-to-cook fermented uji flour available from Kenyan grocery stores and supermarkets.
